# EmployeeManagementSystem
This is a Java-based Employee Management Web Application developed using Servlets, JSP, JDBC, and Oracle Database, following the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture.

The application allows users to manage employee records through various operations such as adding, updating, searching, and viewing employees.
It also supports user authentication using username and password, where login credentials are stored and validated from the database.

All application data is stored in the Oracle database and retrieved dynamically using JDBC

## 📂 Package Description

1️⃣ Bean Layer (EmpBean & LoginBean)

The Bean layer contains JavaBeans that are used to store data and transfer it between the Controller and DAO layers.

🔹 EmpBean
-Acts as a JavaBean to hold employee-related data.
-Used to pass employee information between JSP, Controller, and DAO.

Stores:
-Employee Number (eno)
-Employee Name (ename)
-Employee Salary (esal)
-Implements Serializable.

🔹 LoginBean
-Acts as a JavaBean to hold user authentication data.
-Used during the login process to transfer credentials between JSP, Controller, and DAO.

Stores:
-Username (username)
-Password (password)
-Helps validate user credentials against the database.

2️⃣ Controller Layer (addServlets)
-Handles HTTP requests from JSP pages.
-Reads user input (employee details) from the request.
-Sends data to the DAO layer for database operations.
-Controls navigation between JSP pages using RequestDispatcher.

3️⃣ Model / DAO Layer (EmpDoa)

-Responsible for all database operations using JDBC.
-Performs CRUD operations on employee records stored in the database.

Operations performed:
-Add employee details into the database
-Update employee salary
-Search employee by ID
-Retrieve and display all employees from the database

4️⃣ Service Layer (Dbconnection)

-Manages the database connection.
-Loads Oracle JDBC driver.
-Provides a reusable Connection object.

```bash
Database URL : jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:SID
Username     : "Username of your Database"
Password     : "Password of your Database"
```

## 🗄️ Database Details

📌 Employee Table

Stores all employee records entered through the application.
```bash
CREATE TABLE emp (
    eno NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    ename VARCHAR2(50),
    esal NUMBER
);
```
Employee data is:
-Inserted into the database when a new employee is added
-Updated when employee details are modified
-Retrieved from the database for search and view operations

---

## 📌 User Authentication Table

Stores login credentials for application users.
```bash
CREATE TABLE users (
    userid NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR2(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL
);
```

---

## 📌 Insert Sample Username & Password
```bash
INSERT INTO users (username, password)
VALUES ('admin', 'admin123');

COMMIT;
```
🔐 These credentials are validated during login by retrieving data from the database.

⚠️ Note:
Passwords are stored in plain text for learning/demo purposes only.
In real-world applications, passwords should be encrypted or hashed
